# Xpanar_initialization
The Demo program about Xplanar initialization of Beckhoff

In theory, as long as there is enough spacing for the movers to move, no matter how many movers are in the specified area, they can move to their initial position

Before you can use this demo, you will need to install beckhoff's Xplanar function, including but not limited to TF5890 and TF5400.
A basic Xplanar configuration environment can be found on the Beckhoff website.
The library used in this demo is based on TwinCAT 4024
